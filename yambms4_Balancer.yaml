# Please use the native `api` component instead of the `mqtt` section.
# If you use Home Assistant, the native API is more lightweight.
# If there is no HA server connected to this API, the ESP32 reboots every 15 minutes to try to resolve the problem.
# The "reboot_timeout: 0s" option will keep your ESP32 up and running even if you lose connection to your HA server.
api:
  reboot_timeout: 0s

# If you don't want to use ESPHome's native API you can use MQTT instead.
# In this case don't forget to remove the 'api:' section.

#   username: !secret mqtt_username
#   password: !secret mqtt_password

# Please note that enabling this component will take up a lot of memory and may decrease
# stability and be the cause of reboot depending on the capabilities of the board used.
