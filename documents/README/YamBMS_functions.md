## CAN protocol

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to check if your inverter model is on the list of [supported inverters](Supported_devices.md#supported-inverter). In any case it must support one of the following `CAN` bus protocols.

Choose the CAN protocol that will be sent to your inverter and don't forget to configure your inverter for the protocol you choose.

The table below helps you choose the best protocol depending on your inverter brand.
Other configurations are possible, don't hesitate to communicate what works well for you.

| Inverter | Battery mode | CAN protocol |

## Charging settings

![Image](../../images/YamBMS_Charging_Settings.png "YamBMS_Charging_Settings")

The `Charging status` represents the current charging phase, see the [Charging logic](Charging_logic.md).

The `Charging instruction` is defined based on the `Charging status` and allows the correct `Requested Charge Values` ​​to be sent.

The `Float charge enabled` switch allows the battery to be kept fully charged at the end of the `Bulk` charge. The voltage used will be that of the `Float voltage` slider.

The `EOC timer enabled` switch ensures that the `Cut-Off` phase lasts maximum `30 min` (default value) even if your cells are still being equalized. If your cells are equalized, the `Cut-Off` phase will end at the earliest after `60s` (default value). This prevents the risk of staying in the `Cut-Off` phase for many hours if you have several batteries and they are poorly equalized.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have **totally unbalanced batteries** and want to fix this problem, you can disable the `EOC timer` and let `YamBMS` balance your batteries, **this can take hours**. A well balanced battery does not need this timer enabled as the equalization phase will finish in less than 30 minutes.

The `Bulk voltage` slider allows you to set the voltage used during the `Bulk`, `Balancing` and `Cut-Off` phases.

The `Float voltage` slider allows you to set the voltage used after charging is complete if the `Float charge enabled` switch is enabled.

The `Inverter Offset V.` slider allows you to correct the inverter charge voltage, either because it does not respect the requested value or because your inverter is far from your batteries and there is a voltage drop. This allows you to reach the target `Bulk` or `Float` charge voltage by adding an offset.

### Max current (%)

![Image](../../images/YamBMS_Max_Current_PCT.png "YamBMS_Max_Current_PCT")

The allowed charge or discharge current is automatically calculated based on the `OCP` values ​​of your BMS. The `OCP` currents of the combined BMS (not in alarm) are added together and the requested current is a percentage `0~90%` of this value.

### ReBulk

![Image](../../images/YamBMS_ReBulk.png "YamBMS_ReBulk")

There are two parameters to start a new `Bulk` phase. You can set a `Rebulk SoC` or a `Rebulk V.` value, only one of these conditions must be met.

If needed you can also force a `Bulk` charge with the `Force Bulk (top bal)` switch. The switch will automatically deactivate when your cells enter the `Balancing` phase.

### Request Force Charge

![Image](../../images/YamBMS_Request_Force_Charge.png "YamBMS_Request_Force_Charge")

This function allows you to force a charge from `GRID` :
- when `SoC <= Start SoC` the forced charge start
- when `SoC >= Stop SoC` the forced charge stop

Works only with `PYLON`, `LuxPower` and `Victron` protocols.

## Auto functions

Thanks to [@MrPabloUK](https://github.com/MrPabloUK) for developing `Auto CVL`, `Auto CCL` and `Auto DCL` functions.

A [reference spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UwZ94Qca-DBP5gppzKmAjbMJYZGjR4lMwZtwwQR9wWY/edit?usp=sharing) has been created that shows how the `Auto CVL, CCL & DCL` works.

Thanks to [@GHswitt](https://github.com/GHswitt) for developing `Auto Float` function.

## Auto CVL

![Image](../../images/YamBMS_Auto_CVL.png "YamBMS Auto CVL")

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Auto CVL` function uses the `Balance Trig. Volt.` value of your BMS. `e.g. for LFP` : BTG=0.010V

When enabled, the `Automatic Charge Voltage Limit` feature will automatically reduce the `Requested Charge Voltage (CVL)` sent to the inverter when a cell starts to exceed the bulk target.
That way, the runner cell should be maintained at or near bulk (for example, 3.45v) and the balancer can start to bring up the lagging cells.
Controlling the CVL is the preferred option according to Victron and others, but it depends on how well your inverter behaves.
My Solis inverter is not great at CVL control, so it doesn't work well for me.

You can compare `Auto CVL` to cruise control in a car.

`Boost Charge V.` allows you to increase the charging voltage to charge your battery faster, the `Auto CVL` function will itself reduce the charging voltage at the end of charging so that it does not exceed the target voltage `Bulk Voltage`.

## Auto CCL & DCL

![Image](../../images/YamBMS_Auto_CCL_DCL.png "YamBMS Auto CCL & DCL")

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Auto CCL` function uses the `OVP` value of your BMS.
> The `Auto DCL` function uses the `UVP` value of your BMS.

Regarding the new `Auto Charge/Discharge Current Limit`, this features has been introduced to hopefully prevent `OVP` and `UVP` alarms.

When enabled, the `Automatic Charge Current Limit` feature will automatically reduce the `Requested Charge Current (CCL)` sent to the inverter when a cell starts to exceed the bulk target.
This should prevent the runner cell from exceeding the max voltage cutoff, but doesn't maintain it at bulk voltage - instead it should keep it just below max cell voltage.

You can compare `Auto CCL` to a max speed limiter in a car.

`Auto DCL` works the same way when a cell approaching `UVP + 0.2`.

Current control should work with any inverter that uses `CAN` control.

## Auto Float Voltage

![Image](../../images/YamBMS_Auto_Float.png "YamBMS Auto Float")

When switching from `Bulk` to `Float`, therefore lowering the `Requested Charge Voltage (CVL)`, some inverters (e.g. Deye SUN-12K) will start to discharge the battery (into the grid) with up to max. discharge current until the
`Requested Charge Voltage (CVL)` is reached. The reason behind this is that the inverter sees this as battery overvoltage and wants to counter it. 
As workaround, by enabling `Automatic Float Voltage`, it will lower the `Requested Charge Voltage (CVL)` gradually in small steps until the float voltage is reached, allowing the battery more time to settle down.
There are two modes available: `Follow` and `Immediately`.

- `Follow`: Waits until the battery voltage itself is below the current `Requested Charge Voltage (CVL)` before lowering `Requested Charge Voltage (CVL)` further. It follows the battery voltage until the target float voltage is reached.
- `Immediately`: Immediately start lowering the `Requested Charge Voltage (CVL)`, independent of the current battery voltage. That means it can go below the current battery voltage.

This feature might not work with all inverters as good or is not required if these do not discharge the battery.

The voltage steps can be configured (default `0.1V`) with `Auto Float Voltage Step`. The update interval can be configured (default `3 minutes`) with `Auto Float Update Interval`.

## Requested Values

![Image](../../images/YamBMS_Requested_Values.png "YamBMS_Requested_Values")

These 4 sensors allow you to see what is being requested of your inverter.

In the example below, we are in the `Float` phase at a voltage of `53.6V` and an `Inverter Offset V.` of `0.1V`. The `Requested Charge Voltage` is therefore `53.7V`.

The `Requested Discharge Voltage` is the `UVP + 0.2` value of your BMS multiplied by the number of cells, in this example (3V * 16).

The `Requested Charge/Discharge Current` is the `OCP` value of your BMS multiplied by the `Max current` percentage, in this example (150A * 80%).

## Inverter Heartbeat Monitoring

![Image](../../images/YamBMS_Inverter_Heartbeat.png "YamBMS_Inverter_Heartbeat")

This feature allows you to monitor the heartbeat of your inverter (time between two ACK 0x305). This is useful for troubleshooting purposes and should not remain enabled continuously.

This heartbeat must be regular and depends on the selected `CAN protocol` and the behavior of the inverter. If the heartbeat is not regular this can show a problem on the inverter side or an overloaded ESP32.

The `Deye` inverter sends an ACK `0x305` in response to the reception of a CAN frame `0x356`. Knowing that CAN frames are sent every `100ms` and that the CAN protocol `PYLON 1.2` has 6 CAN frames, the heartbeat of the `Deye` inverter is `600ms`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Every `2h` Deye takes more than `3s` to respond and more than `5s` at midnight.
> This is what the `CANBUS Status` looks like when the `canbus_link_timer` is set to `3s`.
